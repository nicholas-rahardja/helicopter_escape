# Helicopter Escape 

This game is developed using Python and Pygame. The game is inspired by Flappy Bird and involves flying a helicopter through gaps in buildings while trying to obtain items and rewards. 
The game also gets harder over time with the gaps between buildings getting smaller and the helicopter speed increasing. The game also has a leaderboard functionality allowing players to save their high scores. 

## How to play the game? 

After cloning the repo, install the pygame libary. Then navigate to the folder and run 'helicopter_escape.py'.
