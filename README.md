# Helicopter Escape 

This game is developed using Python and Pygame. The game is inspired by Flappy Bird and involves flying a helicopter through gaps in buildings while obtaining items and rewards. The game also gets more challenging over time, with the gaps between buildings getting smaller and increasing helicopter speed. The game also has a leaderboard functionality allowing players to save their high scores.

## How to play the game? 

After cloning the repo, install the pygame libary. Then navigate to the folder and run 'helicopter_escape.py'.
